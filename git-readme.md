# Learning git

This file is a place for some hints and links about git.

## Installing on Windows

The Github Desktop provides a graphical interface for working with github, but does not provide a command line utility. This results in VSCode complaining that a git client was not found.

The recommended approach is to install Github Desktop, and install a command line client.

Github Desktop installer can be found here: [github.com/apps/desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop)

Command line client can be found here: [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
